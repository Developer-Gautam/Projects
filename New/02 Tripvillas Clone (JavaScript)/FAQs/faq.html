        <p id="q">Why should you make sure that you always book through Tripvillas.com and not directly with the owner?</p>
    <p>Your credit card information is safe and never shared with the owners of properties.</p>
    <p>You benefit from our intervention in case the property owner has misrepresented the facts or anything goes wrong during your travel.</p>
    <p>You benefit from our refund policy in case you decide to change your mind.</p>
    <p>You need to have at least 100USD in your account before you request for payout. On being eligible for payout, you can empty your account.</p>
    <p id="q">How do I cancel my booking?</p>
    <p>Please contact our team at support@tripvillas.com if you want to cancel your booking and they will assist you.</p>
    <p id="q">What is the cancellation policy?</p>
    <p>Cancellations done 90 Days before the check-in date receive 50% of the booking amount minus a 200USD processing fee.</p>
    <p>Cancellations done less than 90 days before the check-in date are not eligible for any refunds.</p>
    <p>Please note that our properties are private holiday homes and not Hotels with dedicated marketing teams. It is not possible for the owners to accommodate cancellations especially due to the seasonal nature of travel.</p>
