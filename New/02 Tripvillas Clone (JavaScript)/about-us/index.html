    <div id="aboutTripvillas">
        <p>Tripvillas is one of Asia's largest Holiday Home Rental Companies. The company was founded in late 2009 by Roshan D'Silva when looking for ways to generate additional income from Coffee Plantations owned by his family in India. Inspired by Craigslist, Roshan set out to create a simple website where owners of private homes could create a simple profile for their property and then correspond with like minded families who would be interested in staying in their homes as an alternate to hotels.</p>
        <p>Over the years, Tripvillas has grown to add to it's core rental business other key businesses to serve the Holiday Home industry in Asia. These include a Software business, a Vacation Community Management Business, Property Management including brokerage and Interiors of Vacation Homes, Branded development of Vacation Communities and an Exchange Program where Holiday Home owners can exchange their unsold nights with other Owners.</p>
        <p>Tripvillas is headquartered in Singapore and has entered new businesses over the years to move the Holiday Home industry in Asia forward in tune with the needs and wants of consumers and Property Investors. We are passionate about the industry and about it's importance to families as they look to spend more time with each other. We are also very conscious of our social responsibility - and work closely with multiple stakeholders to balance generation of wealth for Asian families by income producing properties while protecting the local Art, Culture, Tribes, Cuisine and Wildlife. Without the uniqueness of Asia, we believe there would be nothing to see and hence our very existence would be at threat.</p>
        <p>Tripvillas is backed by some of the world's leading Angel groups and Funds. Our Founder and the Management team are Majority owners and are fully aligned with the success of the business.</p>
